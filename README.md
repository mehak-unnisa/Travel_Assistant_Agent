By combining up-to-the-minute web search capabilities with open-source geographical data, this agent moves beyond static itineraries to provide dynamic, relevant, and location-aware recommendations for any traveler.

## ✨ Features

This agent is built to be your digital concierge, offering the following core functionalities:
- **Destination & Trip Ideas**: Generates personalized suggestions for destinations, themes, and detailed trip itineraries based on user input.
- **Real-Time Context**: Surfaces **relevant travel news, event information, and advisories** by querying the web, ensuring all plans are based on current data.
- **Hyperlocal Discovery (OpenStreetMap)**: Finds nearby points of interest, including **hotels, cafes, restaurants, and landmarks**, leveraging the power of **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** data, requiring no external paid mapping API -keys.
- **Geospatial Intelligence**: Accurately **geocodes** locations (converts names/addresses to coordinates) and contextualizes all location information for precise planning.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
